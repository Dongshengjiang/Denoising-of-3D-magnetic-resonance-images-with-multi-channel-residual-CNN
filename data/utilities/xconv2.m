function Y = xconv2(I,G)
% function Y = xconv2(I,G)
%   I: the original image
%   G: the mask to be convoluted
%   Y: the convoluted result (by taking fft2, multiply and ifft2)
% 
%   a similar version of the MATLAB conv2(I,G,'same'),  7/10/95
%   implemented by fft instead of doing direct convolution as in conv2
%   the result is almost same , differences are under 1e-10.
%   However, the speed of xconv2 is much faster than conv2 when
%   gaussian kernel has large standard variation.
